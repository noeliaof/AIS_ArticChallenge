# AutoICE Challenge


### Description

This repository has been created for the AutoICE Challenge from AI4EO-ESA and the initial set-up is based on https://github.com/astokholm/AI4ArcticSeaIceChallenge. 

### Challenge overview

The objective of the AutoICE challenge is to advance the state of the art of sea ice parameter retrieval from SAR data resulting in an increased capacity to derive more robust and accurate automated sea ice maps. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has great potential within automated prediction of sea ice in satellite images.
